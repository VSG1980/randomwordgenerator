I have managed to create a server and client, made them both communicate and run. Also built an api for words in the dictionary and have 3 fields words/definition and example. It then showed a list of arrays, in which i then made it so that only one word would show each time i pressed the random word generator.After that i styled the css so that it would be responsive and js to style aswell.
