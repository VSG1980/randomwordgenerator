I have managed to create a server and client, made them both communicate and run. Also built an api for words in the dictionary and have 3 fields words/definition and example. It then showed a list of arrays, in which i then made it so that only one word would show each time i pressed the random word generator.After that i styled the css so that it would be responsive and js to style aswell. Had some issues with getting only on word on at a time, and with help of web3 and youtube i managed to get it working. I also used chat gpt to come up with interesting words to use in my API with examples and definitions too. Also have got it mobile responsive.
